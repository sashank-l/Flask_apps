See `weather-dashboard/requirements.txt` for complete dependency list.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sashankL-01/Flask_apps.git
cd Flask_apps
```

### Set Up Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
# For weather dashboard
cd weather-dashboard
pip install -r requirements.txt

# For blog website (install Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy)
pip install Flask Flask-SQLAlchemy
```

### Configuration

#### Blog Website
1. Navigate to `blog_website/`
2. Update the secret key in `app.py`
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

#### Weather Dashboard
1. Navigate to `weather-dashboard/`
2. Get an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
3. Replace `"your api key"` in `app.py` with your actual API key
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## üåü Features Demonstrated

### Database Operations
- SQLAlchemy ORM models
- Database relationships (One-to-Many)
- CRUD operations
- Database migrations

### Web Development Patterns
- MVC architecture
- Template inheritance
- Static file serving
- Form handling
- Session management
- Flash messaging

### API Development
- RESTful API design
- JSON response handling
- External API integration
- AJAX requests
- Error handling

### Frontend Technologies
- Responsive design
- JavaScript DOM manipulation
- Form validation
- Dynamic content loading

## üì± Usage

### Blog Website
1. Register a new account or login
2. View all posts on the homepage
3. Click on individual posts to read them
4. Logout when finished

### Weather Dashboard
1. Enter a city name to get current weather
2. Save frequently checked locations as favorites
3. View your search history
4. Load favorite locations for quick access

## üîß Development Notes

### Security Considerations
- The blog website stores passwords in plain text (for demo purposes only)
- In production, implement proper password hashing
- Use environment variables for sensitive data like API keys

### Database
- Both apps use SQLite databases
- Databases are created automatically on first run
- Located in respective project directories

## ü§ù Contributing

Feel free to:
- Add new Flask applications
- Improve existing features
- Fix bugs or security issues
- Enhance documentation
- Add tests
